I am an R and shiny enthusiast, contributing back to the community after several years of almost living on R whilst at work.

I have also started trying the Advent of Code challenge, follow me progress [here](/advent-of-code).

When time allows, I also enjoy cross-stitching. Completed projects are viewable [here](/crossstitch).
